# Unknown Chat View 👀

The art of presenting json in a pretty way 😁 But a project like <a href="https://unknown-chat.netlify.app">Unknown Chat</a> which is moon scalable 😅 frontend is not that way its do a ton of work under the hood 💪



### What does this do ??

* Nothing !! 😅
* Sign up with google 😉
* Showing you all the rooms that are currently public 📢
* Join you in a room 😁
* You messages chat all the freaking stuff .....



Frontend is made using `react js` and used `firebase` for authentication
