# Unknown Chat Database ğŸ“‚

I used **JSON SERVER** for database ğŸ’¾ 

read <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server">DocsÂ ğŸ“š</a> for understanding more about json server



### Setup

You need **NODE JS** and **NPM** for this



1. install dependencies by `npm install`
2. run server by `node server.js`



server will listen on port 8000

http://localhost:8000 

you will be having two end points on server url

`/users` 

`/rooms`

because in `/database.db.json` 

```json
{
  "rooms": [],
  "users": []
}
```

like this you can add more endpoint too ğŸ˜‰
